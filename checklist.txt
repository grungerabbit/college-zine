College Checklist
=================
In our first meeting my academic advisor told me to “take all the fuckin’ ice cream.” This man has advanced degrees from Columbia, MIT, and Harvard, and he was, in his way, trying to say something critical: chill out. Calm down. Take it slow. 

I was too impressed by “fuckin’ ice cream.”

That’s a good marker of how expectant and excited and naïve I was going into college—you will be too, no matter how jaded you think you are. You will be lost, mostly, but feel like you need to rush-party--reinvent—network and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

Here are some aphorisms. May they be less cryptic, and sufficiently explained.
~+~


NEW YOU
=======
# College is what you make of it.

Let's start with a huge cliché, because college can be that too. You can have a mass-media experience, of beer bongs and sex and parties and hot people and woo rinse repeat.

// stuff about high school, the differences

# But remember, COLLEGE IS A HUGE PRIVILEGE. Don't waste it.

How much $$$$$$$ does college cost again oh yeah a whole shitload
// need much more here


# College oscillates. It is transitory and transient. It is contradictory. Welcome!~~~~

Being a freshman is a blank slate. The first few weeks will feel like summer camp. The administration will coddle you with fun activities and everyone will be on their best behavior, with their shiniest masks. 

Take all the ice cream here, literal and metaphorical, because they won't offer it to you again. Make friends with randos, maybe they'll be forgotten, maybe they'll be your best friend. Ease into it. Feel scared. Feel great.

// need more here




# College is a time for you to be selfish. But "you" extends past "you at 18-22+-3 years old." 

College offers a level of protection and freedom that is unparalleled. It is for you to determine how to live the rest of your life. You are now the decider, not your parents, not anyone else. 

You are expected to take care of yourself, negotiate living with others, and do your own laundry. You will make a lot of mistakes and experiences. They may be exhilirating or irresponsible. They may be callous and unthinking. They might be agonizingly mundane.

They will be revelatory.




INTELLECTUAL
========

# Due diligence.



# Professors are everything.
They are no longer proxies for the same curriculum, with more or less efficacy.

Ask questions. Ask for help. Advocate for yourself. Say no.





Do your homework. This is a college lesson, but also a life lesson. Go to class. Talk with your professors after class. Hang
out with your TA. Use their office hours. 

# Read.
Read your academic readings. Read the contracts you are asked to 
sign. Read books for fun—academic libraries, oof—hold on

# USE YOUR SCHOOL’S LIBRARY and other resources.
You are spending so much money. Take advantage of the facilities. The library, the gym, the art gallery, the "free" bacon, the hokey activities and RA that you'll miss once Freshman year is over and they are no longer obligatory.


Audit and drop classes.
Do not be ashamed to admit that you need help, whether personal, 
academic, or otherwise.
Asking will get you further than not asking, unless you suck at asking.
Bend the rules. Know which ones to bend


Start your essay earlier than you think you should.

Discuss the material in class and in your head and with your friends 
who are pre-med and art history and economics and comp-sci and agriculture and didn't even go to school

ASK ASK ASK you are helpless it's okay
Learning is about synthesis. Tracking is about specialization. Make 
friends who are outside.

College is about exuberance
and about learning
the time is short
go make stuff
everything you make can add

SOCIAL
======
Get a laptop. Get a fake ID. Get a grip.


Introverts: practice talking.
Extroverts: practice listening.
Keep a journal. You’ll find your previous selves charming, maybe infuriating.
The best way to learn a skill is to practice, and the best practice is [tinkering? Making?]

Always reconsider. Think about your position. Go 180. Now 90. Now the other gradations we never talk about. Consider a perspective from 23, or in 3D or 4D.

a rigid adherence to progressive ideals is just as unforgiving and rigid as any other kind of ideology.

PHYSICAL
========


Be happy.
Take care of your body.
DON’T START SMOKING



EMOTIONAL
=========

# You don't need to know it all or do it alone.



VOCATIONAL
==========

No one will have a stable career anymore. There is opportunity for change [heeeyey, cliche]. So much potential

explore
make mistakes get hands on that's how you learn the best reading can only do so much taking other peoples' innovations can only get you so far… not very far


Modulation-moderation

have projects all the time. have nothing all the time.





jobs search can be done before you're out of school
shopping around and knowing what you should have experience with/skills

have a second and third and fourth plan
make them tenuous
be open to change cuz its cominnngaa
fallback and fallback and fallback

practice and practice and practice




functional?


YOU YOU
=======



bite off more than you can chew and send it back
you get to decide what is most important to you

don't waste all of your time 


self care

relax, take time to do nothing but for yourself. it seems selfish, and it totally is, but it can help you recharge and function better as a human later.


#YOLO is so 2011, but if the OO is endangering the YL, then it’s not logically worth it, is it


TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF.

Be humble - humility isn't about
reality isn't about quashing idealism
but know which ones are dead ends
// theme of learning what is and what isn't

BONUS: NYC SIDEBAR
==================

# They sold you on "All of NYC is your campus." SO GO OUTSIDE.

And not just bars and clubs in Manhattan. Learn the subway system. Drinking yourself to death in your room isn't a thing you need to do here.

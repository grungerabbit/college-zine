College Checklist
=================
In our first meeting my academic advisor told me to “take all the fuckin’ ice cream.” This man has advanced degrees from Columbia, MIT, and Harvard, and he was, in his way, trying to say something critical: chill out. Calm down. Take it slow. 

I was too impressed by “fuckin’ ice cream.”

That’s a good marker of how expectant and excited and naïve I was going into college—you will be too, no matter how jaded you think you are. You will be lost, mostly, but feel like you need to rush-party--reinvent—network and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

Here are some aphorisms. May they be less cryptic, and sufficiently explained.
~+~


NEW YOU
=======
# College is what you make of it.

Let's start with a huge cliché, because college can be that too. You can have a mass-media experience, of beer bongs and sex and parties and hot people and woo rinse repeat.

# But remember, COLLEGE IS A HUGE PRIVILEGE. Don't waste it.

How much $$$$$$$ does college cost again oh yeah a whole shitload
// need much more here


# College oscillates. It is transitory and transient. It is contradictory. Welcome!~~~~

Being a freshman is a blank slate. The first few weeks will feel like summer camp. The administration will coddle you with fun activities and everyone will be on their best behavior, with their shiniest masks. 

Take all the ice cream here, literal and metaphorical, because they won't offer it to you again. Make friends with randos, maybe they'll be forgotten, maybe they'll be your best friend. Ease into it. Feel scared. Feel great.

// need more here




# College is a time for you to be selfish. But "you" extends past "you at 18-22+-3 years old." 

College offers a level of protection and freedom that is unparalleled. It is for you to determine how to live the rest of your life. You are now the decider, not your parents, not anyone else. You are setting up your future, if not directly in college, then in this "young adult" time period of your life.

You are expected to take care of yourself, negotiate living with others, and do your own laundry. You will make a lot of mistakes and experiences. They may be exhilirating or irresponsible. They may be callous and unthinking. They might be agonizingly mundane.

They will be revelatory.



INTELLECTUAL
========




# Professors are everything.
They are no longer proxies for the same curricula, with more or less efficacy.






# We're not in high school anymore, Toto.
Don't half-ass learning. Do your homework. This is a college lesson, but also a life lesson. Go to class. Talk with your professors after class about specific points or further material. Hang out with your TA. Use their office hours. Start your essay earlier than you think you should. 

You can no longer (or should no longer) coast on above-average intelligence and clever homework cheating tactics alone. No one is going to force you to learn, or do anything, except for you. If you don't like learning, perhaps reconsider why you are taking the course or attending college in the first place.


# Due diligence.

# Read.
Read your academic readings. Slowly and fully. Read the contracts you are asked to sign. Read books for fun. Read cereal boxes and advertisements. Read because you love/hate/know nothing about the topic. Speaking of which...

# USE YOUR SCHOOL’S LIBRARY and other resources.
You are spending so much money on them. Take advantage of the facilities. The library, the gym, the art gallery, the "free" bacon, the computer lab, the hokey activities and RA that you'll miss once Freshman year is over and they are no longer obligatory. You will miss everything once you are out.




# Be choosy. You're paying for it.
At most schools, you get a week or two to audit and drop classes without penalty. The first week is syllabus week, where professors present themselves and the concept of their courses. Take advantage of this: collect syllabi, drop any courses that don't seem like a good fit, try to get into cool courses by talking to the professor.

This extends further, too. If you don't like your major, switch. If you don't like your school, switch. You can do all of these things. The inconvenience of switching is nothing when compared to being dissatisfied and feeling like you've wasted your time or opportunities.


# Ask and advocate.
Ask questions. Ask for help. Stand up for yourself. Say no. Do not be ashamed to admit that you need help, whether personal, 
academic, or otherwise.

You know and control yourself. You are your own agent. However, college provides so many resources and openings that you can access by asking. Seek out mentors. People tend to help others, especially when you tell them you are a student. They feel validated, you gain their expertise, it's a win-win.

It is okay to be lost. You are not helpless. You are not alone.


# Asking will get you further than not asking, unless you suck at asking.
Bend the rules. Know which ones to bend. Learn how to interact with authority figures (or, all people) in a constructive, respectful way, even if you do not agree with them. Seething and being pissy does nothing for anyone. Practice being humble, sucking up your pride, assertively managing (but not dictatorially controlling) any situtation.


# Learning is about synthesis.
Tracking is about specialization. Make friends who are outside. Discuss thoughts and new material in class and in your head and with your friends. Talk with pre-med and chimney sweeps and art history and economics and comp-sci and agriculture and professional beaders.

# You will learn some important theory, but remember reality.
Pretentious ? know it all?
//stuff

# The time is shorter than you think.
High school felt like infinity because you were restricted in ways you could bristle against. College is about exuberance and about exploring in a controlled, but open environment. Go make stuff! Go fall in love! Go learn! Go outside!





SOCIAL
======
# Get a laptop. Get a fake ID. Get a grip.
Social media is not synonymous to social interaction. Bars are not synonymous to social interaction. But... they can be fun!
// what was i saying again

# Modulation-moderation

# Introverts: practice talking. Extroverts: practice listening.
You need to be able to interact with others in order to succeed. Talking and listening need to be in balance.

# Develop empathy.
These may be the most selfish days of your life but you are not the only person in the world.
// WANT U TO MAAAAAAKE MEEEEE FEEEEEL LIKE IM THE ONLY GRL IN THE WRLD


# You are not always right. Always reconsider. 
Think again about your position. Go 180º. Now 90º. Now the other gradations we never talk about. Consider a perspective from 23º, or in 3D or 4D. A rigid adherence to progressive ideals is just as unforgiving as one to any other kind of ideology.

# You cannot control or change anyone else based on the strength of your own will alone.

# Say no when you want to say no.

boyfs and girlfs
they can be important and stabilizing but also the opposite of that

// and sex and stuff
// sex and boys and stuff
// and sex and girls and stuff
// relationshipzzzz?

PHYSICAL
========


# You are young and hot and everyone knows. Enjoy it! 
Take pics! Take care of your body! Have it now and have it later.

# DON’T START SMOKING
Grossygross

# Be happy.


EMOTIONAL
=========

# You don't need to know it all or do it alone.


# Keep a journal. 
You’ll find your previous selves charming, embarassing, maybe infuriating. That's how you'll know you have grown.




VOCATIONAL
==========

# The future won't look like the past.
No one will have a stable career anymore. There is opportunity and potential here to do your own venture, but more generally, you must become adaptable to change, because it's coming, bro. Have fallbacks. Second and third and fourth plans. Make hopeful plans but don't rely on them. Train for everything. Learn how to learn.

# Change does not just occur spontaneously.
The future will be bottom-up, not top-down. However, this means being [[[[[?]]]]]

# Tinker. Make. Start. Do.
The best way to learn a skill is to practice. Theory will only get you so far. Making something, however shitty, teaches you lessons about what works and what doesn't. Mistakes and hands-on experience is the best learning, and they can be self-guided! You don't need to do stuff only in context of an employer or other organization! You are your own person!

# Show off.
Make a portfolio of those cool things and share them with everyone. Websites are easy to set up. Everyone talks about "internet presence"-- a great one is helpful, a terrible one is terrible. 
// what did i mean here again


# It's okay that you are privileged.
We have the power to reach people worldwide. We have a lot of capital. We have time and patience and intelligence. We can do fuckin' anything. This is privilege, sure, but the nice part is being able to use it for good (or at least enriching) purposes. Don't take it for granted.

# Qualify yourself for as many jobs as possible.
Even if you don't like "corporate" or want to do your own thing, or you're not interested in a particular sector, knowing what skills are sought-after is helpful for your fallbacks. Take unpaid internships only if they are truly instructive. Take paid internships only if they are truly helpful. Search job opportunity sites and see what kind of jobs look interesting. Use this time to experiment and gain experience.




YOU YOU
=======



bite off more than you can chew and send it back
you get to decide what is most important to you

don't waste all of your time 


self care

relax, take time to do nothing but for yourself. it seems selfish, and it totally is, but it can help you recharge and function better as a human later.


#YOLO is so 2011, but if the OO is endangering the YL, then it’s not logically worth it, is it


TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF.

Be humble - humility isn't about
reality isn't about quashing idealism
but know which ones are dead ends
// theme of learning what is and what isn't

if you have experienced something terrible it is okay to need to sort that out it is okay to take your time with it it is okay to find the best goddamn therapist money can buy it is okay to take a semester off

And not just bars and clubs in Manhattan. Learn the subway system. Drinking yourself to death in your room isn't a thing you need to do here.
